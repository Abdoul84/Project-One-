# Project-One-

Team: Richard, Abdoul, Alexandra, Zac

Questions:

Is the movement towards electric vehicles truly a benefit
To the planet and people (2015 – 2018)
Questions to answer:
What is/has been the impact on Carbon Dioxide emissions? – Mandler, Alex
Who owns Evs? – Abdoul, Zac
Does one type of climate provide better conditions for EV ownership vs total car sales? – Richard, Zac
Datasets and APIs
Census, Google Maps, OpenWeatherMap, Alliance for Automotive Innovation

Findings:

Move from analyzing based on State level to City/County level.
Rural vs Urban areas could have a drastic difference in HMI and EV ownershi
California as an outlier is affecting the trend, still positive, but not as drastic as scatter plot indicates
Climates and EV sales do not show a strong correlation, most sales exist in the Moist/Sub-tropical zone (FL and CA)
Snow show no influence on the sales as shown with many sales in Oregon and the Northeast
Majority of sales are in coastal states
There is not a strong correlation shown of Carbon Emissions and the sale of electric vehicles.
This is not what we were expecting
Overall according to Figure 1 CO2 emissions have declined since 2015.
